""" Q:1 Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?
    A:1 An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts
    the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters
    a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python obj
    that represents an error.
    try: when the code inside try block will run successfully
    except: if try block does'nt run the except block will be executed
    else: if try block will run successfully then else will be defaultly executed
    finally: this block will run in every situation(wather the condition gets
	run or not)"""


""" Q:2 How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception
    classes:
    A:1 there is at least one except statement.
    there are four except statements : try , except, else, finally
    there are many types of built in exception class like systemerror, taberror, typeerror etc.
"""


""" Q:3 When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
    A:3 if try block will run successfully then else will be defaultly executed..
"""


""" Q:4 Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?
    A:4 yes try except block can handle one or more exception.
"""


""" Q:5 When is the finally block executed?
    A:5  this block will run in every situation(wather the condition gets run or not)...
"""


""" Q:6 What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed? 
    A:6 It simply evaluates to False and does not raise any exception.

""" Q:7 What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java
    A:7 oops concept means object oriented programming. it is a very much important part for
        coding in any programming languages like python, java, c++ etc...
        - it supports all the traditional languages.
        - class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction etc.. are all the concepts of
        oops
        - java is not supported multiple inheritance directly.
        - multiple inheritance supported java in the case of interface.
